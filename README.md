# 🤔Reflection🤔

## What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)

This was a side project that showcases what I've learned since Sept 2023, espically for typescript and styled-component.


## Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?

The most challenging part is applying TypeScript (TS), Styled-components, and Firebase to build a project.
I recently learned these skills, and this project gives an excellent opportunity to practice them together. 
Firstly, I find it challenging to construct my styled-components effectively without cluttering my React functional components. 
I planed to maintain clean and readable JSX element while using styled-components.

Secondly, I'm working on creating reusable components like a Button and ensuring that I can easily use them anywhere in my project. 

Finally, TypeScript effectively provides a guard system that helps me avoid unexpected errors. I believe that finishing this project is definitely enhance my TypeScript skill.
